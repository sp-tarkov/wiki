## EFT Pre-Raid Difficulty Settings
Specific bots in EFT can have different difficulty settings unique to other bots in the same raid. This page will refer to a bot's specific difficulty as their <u>difficulty class</u>.

There are 4 different <u>difficulty classes</u> a *specific* bot can have:
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard
- Impossible

The **Pre-Raid** selected difficulty setting determines what <u>difficulty classes</u> are allowed to spawn in your raid:
- As in online: Mix of **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** classes can spawn
- Easy: *Only* **Easy** class bots will spawn
- Medium: *Only* **Medium** class bots will spawn
- ...so on

Note that **SVM** can be used to change which **Pre-Raid** difficulty setting is selected by default, so it is not needed to select the desired difficulty before every raid. Otherwise, it will always default to **As in online**.

## SAIN F6 Difficulty Presets
Each preset will alter the SAIN behavioral settings of each <u>difficulty class</u> individually. This allows you to separately tweak how hard an **Easy** bot is vs. a **Hard** bot, and so on.

Note that this is NOT the same as changing the **Pre-Raid Difficulty Settings**. This will not change which <u>difficulty classes</u> can spawn in the raid, it will only alter the *behaviors* of each class.

## Spawn mods like ABPS and MOAR:
These mods have configuration options to change the likelihood for each bot <u>difficulty class</u> to spawn when **As in online** is chosen in **Pre-Raid Settings**.

*Note: choosing a specific difficulty in **Pre-Raid Settings** will likely override these settings.*

## What does this mean for me?
Consider changing settings in multiple places if you are unhappy with how difficult your game is.

*Bots are too difficult?*
- Choose an easier **SAIN Difficulty Preset**. (ex. Baby Bots)
- Reduce the likelihood of **Hard** bots to spawn with a **Spawn Mod**, *or*:
- Set the bots' difficulty to **Easy** or **Medium** in **Pre-Raid Settings** so that there won't be a chance for **Hard** bots to spawn in your raid.

*Bots are too easy?*
- Choose a harder **SAIN Difficulty Preset**. (ex. Death Wish)
- Set the bots' difficulty to **Hard** or **Impossible** to ensure that there are no **Easy** or **Medium** bots in your raid.
