## Vanilla difficulties
In EFT, there are 4 difficulties a *specific* bot can have:
- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**
- **Impossible**

In Pre-Raid Settings, your selection determines which difficulties are allowed to spawn in your raid:
- As in online: *Mix* of **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** bots
- Easy: *Only* **Easy** bots will spawn
- Medium: *Only* **Medium** bots will spawn
- ...so on

If you have a bot spawning mod installed, it will control what difficulty bots spawn as. **Pre-Raid Settings** might still control the difficulty of the initally spawned bots. Read the mod page to see if this is the case.

SVM can be used to change which difficulty is selected by default in **Pre-Raid Settings**.

## SAIN

Each preset will alter each difficulty individually. This allows you to separately tweak how hard an **Easy** bot is vs. a **Hard** bot, and so on.

You should consider changing settings in BOTH places if you are unhappy with how difficult your game is. 
- If you picked an easier preset and are still having a hard time, try setting the bots' difficulty to **Easy** or **Medium** so that there won't be a chance for **Hard** bots to spawn in your raid.
- If you picked a harder preset and want your bots as difficult as possible, try setting the bots' difficulty to **Hard** or **Impossible**.
