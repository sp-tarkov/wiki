## Vanilla difficulties
In EFT, there are 4 difficulties a *specific* bot can have:
- **Easy**
- **Medium**
- **Hard**
- **Impossible**

In Pre-Raid Settings, your selection determines which difficulties are allowed to spawn in your raid:
- As in online: Mix of **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** bots
- Easy: *Only* **Easy** bots will spawn
- Medium: *Only* **Medium** bots will spawn
- ...so on

## Bot spawning mods

If you have a bot spawning mod installed, it will control what difficulty bots spawn as. **Pre-Raid Settings** might still control the difficulty of the initally spawned bots. Read the mod page to see if this is the case.

## SAIN

Each preset will alter each difficulty individually. This allows you to separately tweak how hard an **Easy** bot is vs. a **Hard** bot, and so on.

You should consider changing settings in BOTH places if you are unhappy with how difficult your game is. 
- If you picked an easier preset and are still having a hard time, try setting the bots' difficulty to **Easy** or **Medium** so that there won't be a chance for **Hard** bots to spawn in your raid.
- If you picked a harder preset and want your bots as difficult as possible, try setting the bots' difficulty to **Hard** or **Impossible**.
