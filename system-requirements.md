# System Requirements
SPT requires more system resources than just running Escape From Tarkov due to its offline nature, where your system is running all parts of a raid locally, of which bots are the main performance impact.

The following are the minimum requirements we have found necessary to reliably run SPT.

| | Minimum Requirements |
|------------------|----------|
| Operating System | Windows 10/11 64-bit |
| CPU              | `Intel Core i5-10400F`/`AMD Ryzen 5 5600` or newer |
| Memory           | 32GB or more |
| GPU              | DX11 compatible with 8GB+ of VRAM |
| Storage          | SSD with 70GB+ of free space |
| Dependencies     | [Escape from Tarkov](https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/purchase) |
