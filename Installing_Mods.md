# Mod installation guide for Single Player Tarkov
Below is a guide on how to install mods for Single Player Tarkov, as well as common issues which users encounter and how to fix them.

## To do before installing your mods
You can find mods for SPT on [The Forge](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/). The Forge is the main hub of mods for SPT, and is the only place to get mods which are supported in the SPT Discord.

When selecting the mods you want to install, make sure that you only install mods that have been updated to your SPT version. If you are unsure what version of SPT you are on, then you can see the SPT version in the top left of the server window or in the bottom left while in-game.
