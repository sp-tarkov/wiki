# Mod installation guide for Single Player Tarkov
Below is a guide on how to install mods for Single Player Tarkov, as well as common issues which users encounter and how to fix them.

## To do before installing your mods
You can find mods for SPT on [The Forge](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/). The Forge is the main hub of mods for SPT, and is the only place to get mods which are supported in the SPT Discord.

It is **highly recommended** that you download and install [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) before you proceed to install mods. Other archiving programs such as WinRAR are known to have corrupt files upon extracting without telling you. [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) has a much lower chance of this happening, as well as informing you should there be an issue.

Make sure that you have already loaded SPT up to the main menu or stash as outlined in the [Installation Guide](/Installation_Guide).

When selecting the mods you want to install, make sure that you only install mods that have been updated to your SPT version. If you are unsure what version of SPT you are on, then you can see the SPT version in the top left of the server window or in the bottom left while in-game.

Read the modpage of the mods you are wanting to install. The majority of the time the mod page contains important information as to what to expect from the mod, how to install the mod, how to configure the mod and **incompatibilities** with other mods. It is important that you do read the modpages of your mods as this will help you identify issues you may encounter in game.

**SPT MUST BE FULLY CLOSED BEFORE YOU INSTALL MODS**
