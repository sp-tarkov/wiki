- Some quests need PMCs to spawn in map locations with no bot spawns, making them impossible to complete (e.g. kill x PMCs in scav fortress/base).
- Selecting the overview tab as a scav can break your client, alt+f4 to revert the raid.
- Your active flea offers are marked as expired when the server is offline and items are returned in the mail.
- Flea categories don't always show the correct number of offers when filtering by item.
- The server will not load when placed in a folder path containing certain unicode characters (Japanese and Korean characters especially).
- Looting a PMC dogtag doesn't always show their name on the post-raid kill screen.
- Insured quest items that are consumed in a quest can be returned to the player.
- Failed quests that're restarted retain their task completion status until client is restarted (e.g. `Bullshit` - Shooting a scav after collecting the flash drive results in that task remaining completed).
- Using a low hp medpack while extracting can result in a 0 resource item being left in your inventory.
- Lightkeeper does not give rewards in-game, they are sent by mail.
- The bitcoin counter in hideout is slightly desynced to your game client, your game will say a bitcoin is ready to collect but the server is ~5 minutes behind.
- Replacing a daily/weekly quest with another from the same trader will cause a client soft lock, restarting the client fixes the issue.
