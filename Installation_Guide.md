# Single Player Tarkov Installation Guide
Below you will find information and a guide on how to correcly install and set-up Single Player Tarkov.


## What you need to do before you install Single Player Tarkov
Verify that your Escape From Tarkov is fully up-to-date, through the BSG Launcher. SPT requires that your EFT is on the latest version. This is so the downpatcher can copy your EFT files and patch them down to the same EFT client version that SPT runs on.

Verify that your Escape From Tarkov works, and that you can load up to at least the main menu or stash. This is particually important if you have just installed Escape From Tarkov so all files can be grenerated.
