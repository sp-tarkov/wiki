# Single Player Tarkov Installation Guide
Below you will find information and a guide on how to correctly install and set-up Single Player Tarkov. Common installation issues and the fixes are at the bottom of the page.


## What you need to do before you install Single Player Tarkov
Verify that your Escape From Tarkov is fully up-to-date, through the BSG Launcher.
SPT requires that your EFT is on the latest version. This is so the downpatcher can copy your EFT files and patch them down to the same EFT client version that SPT runs on.

Verify that your Escape From Tarkov works, and that you can load up to at least the main menu or stash.
This is particularly important if you have just installed Escape From Tarkov so all necessary files can be generated.

## Installing and running Single Player Tarkov
1. Download the [SPT Installer](https://ligma.waffle-lord.net/SPTInstaller.exe). 
- The installer will always download the latest SPT version, it **does not** update a current SPT install.
2. Locate where the SPT Installer was downloaded to and run it.
3. Read the Installer Info page, then click next.
4. Select an install path. 
- **DO NOT** install to a protected location such as Documents or Desktop. Create a folder in the root of a drive and call it SPT. C:\SPT as an example
5. Click 'Start Install' and wait for it to complete.
- Once complete you will be asked if you want to open the Install Folder or Add a Desktop Shortcuts. Tick or untick to your preference.
6. Navigate to your SPT install and run `SPT.Server`.
- Wait for the green text to say "Happy Playing". This may take several minutes on first startup.
7. Run `SPT.Launcher` and follow the onscreen instructions.
- If you want to copy over your Live Game settings, click OK. 
- You can use any username you want. It is recommend that you **do not** use your Live account username. Especially if you plan on recording or streaming SPT.
- 'Login Automatically' will always log into the first profile you created, or the last profile you loaded. You can disable this by clicking Logout in the bottom right then unchecking the option.
- Select your desired game version, each version has a description box telling you a summary of what is included, then click Register.
8. Push 'Start Game' and load into the main menu and stash.
Once you have completed the above, you can now play SPT and install mods found on [The Forge](https://forge.sp-tarkov.com/).
