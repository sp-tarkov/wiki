Here's a rudimentary style guide for the Wiki. Nothing here is set in stone or enforced, and it'll see many changes as the Wiki develops.
Its main purpose is to keep the initial set of pages semi-consistent with each other.

## There's no need for initial titles

The Wiki already includes the page's title and short description as part of its page layout. It's unnecessary to add a second title stating the same right underneath it.

However, it does look tidier with a horizontal bar as the first line on a page. A horizontal line can be added anywhere on a page by including `---`.

## Header sizes

There are 6 different header sizes available. `#` will give you the largest title, while `######` will be the smallest. It
Note that using any header will allow for direct linking to that section of a page e.g.: 



# Largest title
Is usually too big for any use. If a section on a page has a section so seperate from others, consider making it a seperate page instead.
## second largest
The perfect size for section headings
### Third largest 
To seperate larger lists which might required external linking to. Use instead of ordered/unordered lists.
#### Forth largest 
It's too small to work as a heading. Same applies for all the other titles.

##### Fifth largets
###### Sixth largest

## Lists and bulletpoints

Ordered lists should be used for series of steps, while unordered lists should be used for a series.
