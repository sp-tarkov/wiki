# Common Pitfalls

For a lot of people they have never previously asked for support online. There are many known pitfalls that aren't immediately obvious or intuitive.

## [Don't Ask to Ask](https://dontasktoask.com/)

> "Any experts in configuring X mod?"

Quoting directly from the linked website:

"There are plenty of reasons why people who DO have the knowledge would not admit to it. By asking, you're asking for more than what you think you're asking.

You're asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily walling other people out. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I have never used, because the answers are (in a programmer kind of way) common sense."

It makes perfect sense to ask such a question while in a conversation with another person. However, when you ask that in any online public chat, your question will just be ignored.
In the first example, if nobody who saw your message considered themselves an "expert" on a mod, your question would simply be left answered. If you instead asked the question you wanted answered first, chances are somebody would know the answer to it:

> "How can I configure X mod to do Y?"
> "It's in Z config under Y."

## [XY Problem](https://xyproblem.info/)

> "My SPT installer doesn't work but did a few days ago."
> "So you already have SPT installed?"
> "Yes."
> "Then why do you want to install SPT again if you already have it installed?"
> "I installed a mod I don't want anymore."
> "Then just [uninstall the mod](/Uninstalling_Mods)."

It's very common that some will "jump ahead" several steps in an attempt to fix their issue and to then ask for help for that solution, instead of describing the actual issue they have. It's not to discourage anyone from trying to solve their own issues, but to provide context for their requests:

> "I'm trying to reinstall SPT as I installed a mod I don't want, but the SPT installer isn't working."
> "You don't need to reinstall SPT as you can just [uninstall the mod](/Uninstalling_Mods)."

## [Category Mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake)

> "What is the latest version of the SPT installer?"
> "The installer updates itself. Why do you ask?"
> "I want to install the latest version of SPT."
> "The SPT installer [always installs the latest version of SPT](https://wiki.sp-tarkov.com/How_SPT_Works#installation) regardless of its version."

Similar to the XY problem, the category mistake is the misattribution of a property as being linked to something unrelated. We are evolutionarily wired to find patterns in everything, so it's only natural that is happens. Just as with the XY problem, add context for the questions you ask:

> "What version of the SPT installer will install the latest version of SPT?"
> "The SPT installer [always installs the latest version of SPT](https://wiki.sp-tarkov.com/How_SPT_Works#installation) regardless of its version."

# Reporting Bugs

If you are reporting a bug in SPT or a mod, you should do the following:

- Verify that the bug happens because of it. 
  - If it's a bug with SPT, remove all mods. 
  - If it's a bug with a mod, remove all other mods.
  - If it's a bug when two mods are used together, remove all other mods.
- Provide reproducable steps to trigger the bug. The developer will need to recreate the bug to be able to fix it, so list all steps that you need to take to reproduce it.
  - If the bug happens randomly or intermittently, list out a few examples of when and how it occured.
